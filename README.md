## **ZBlog**

## **Introduction**
A Blog App to post blogs.
This is a blog webapp built using Express.js, Node.js and EJS where you can add a new blog, edit it later and also delete it if needed. 
For now, its not integrated with any database, so it won't be able to save your data for multiple sessions. I will add this feature eventually.

To run the webapp, clone the repo and install the required dependencies using the command

**`npm i`**

then run the command

**`node index.js`**

or 

**`nodemon index.js`**
